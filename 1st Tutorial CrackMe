This is 1 out of many ways to defeat the licensing check. I prefer this method as it does not require any patching, which reduces the possibility of destablising the program.
The Licensing algorithm checks the Keyfile.dat for a License Key. It is possible to pass the scheme as long as the License key meets the following conditions: 
1: At least 16 byte long. 
2: The first 8 bytes should not be 0s 
3: Should contain at least 8 "G"s (47h) before any 0s

The Algorithm is something like:

ESI = 0
EBX = 0

For i in licenseKey:
	if i == 0:
		if ESI < 8:
			jmp [Invalid LicenseKey]
		Elseif ESI >=8:
			jmp [Valid License]
	if i == 47h:
		ESI ++
  else:
		EBX ++


The following License key would pass the check:
GGGGGGGGGG000000
